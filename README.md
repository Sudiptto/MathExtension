# MathExtension
Working on a chrome extension that can solve world problems, primarily on the site DeltaMath. I will update this each time I make something significant in the program. 
Currently in the developmental stage. Also would appreciate help, so far all it does is redirect to my website (https://validmath.netlify.app/). This extension is also
apart of my math website project and they will work each other.
